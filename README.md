#### Description:

Tetrix is a clone of the game Tetris written in C using the ncurses and pthreads libraries. It recreates the mechanics of the classic game, which presents a great challenge in understanding how a seemingly simple game can contain so much complexity, including things that are not visible, such as the necessary data structure for the game to exist.

Despite its simplicity, recreating a game like Tetris requires a lot of attention to detail since everything in the game happens very quickly, and also requires a lot of creativity to solve the problems that arise during the project.

"Some implementation details include a two-dimensional structure to simulate a board where the game pieces will move, and how the player will build their strategy, which must be allowed without putting limitations on the player.

Compiling the program for Windows has been tested and works correctly. However, compiling for Linux has not been tested yet and may have some issues.

To compile the program for Windows, you need to install the ncurses and pthreads libraries using Mingw-get, which can be downloaded from the following link: https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Installer/. After installation, you can use the make or make tetrix command to compile the program."

## Testing the Program

You can find the latest compiled and ready-to-use version of the program at the following link: https://github.com/FariasFarias/Tetrix/releases.

## Project Objective

This project was developed as part of the CS50 course at Harvard University.
